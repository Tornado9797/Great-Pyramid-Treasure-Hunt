# Great Pyramid Treasure Hunt
A text-based adventure/puzzle game coded in Python. Originally developed by Brooks Pettit, Hannah Schroeder, and Conner Brewster (me) for their Pre-AP Computer Science midterm project in December 2013. Only I decided to keep the file, so I decided to upload it here.

Requires Python 3.5 to be installed. Run the .py file through the python.exe file. The original file was developed in Python IDLE.
