Level 1

Level 2

Level 3
The user looks around by inputting “look”
User sees a piece of parchment hanging on the wall
User inspects parchment
The parchment contains a riddle
The answer to the riddle about the alphabet
User finds a screwdriver if they look on the floor
Unscrewing a screw on the wall will make some stones fall
Behind them is a puzzle
The goal is to arrange the tiles in alphabetical order
There are fifteen tiles and one “space” tile arranged in a 4 by 4 grid
Each letter has a number
Each position on the grid also has a constant number
Selecting a tile subtracts or adds one or four to the letter’s number 
(depending on the direction in which the space is)
The opposite operation is performed on the space tile
The program matches the letter’s number to the number corresponding with a spot on the grid
A series of print statements place the tile in the right spot
the tiles now move to their corresponding places
Solving the puzzle opens the door to the stairs
Move limit?  Health loss if failure to complete the puzzle within it?

Level 4
User needs to open a door by moving air into two (three?) pipes
(the pressure turns switches, that open the door)
Each pipe is wide, covered with a grille, and set into a wall
(oddly technologically advanced Egyptians…)

It is quite obvious (if the player LOOKs) that there is a switch at the end of each pipe
The switch needs constant air to turn on (riddle)
ONE switch is in throwing distance
Player finds a quickly rotating stick in the wall
(inspecting the wall without looking at it first will result in damage)
Player must find blades to a fan, hidden in a mosaic of an Egyptian Pharaoh
Player turns off spinning stick (puzzle here?)
Xe assembles fan on the spinning stick using screwdriver from level 3
TO PASS, THE PLAYER MUST PUT THIS NEXT TO ONE OF THE DEEPER PIPES
THE ROCK WILL NOT REACH THE SWITCH OF THE DEEPER PIPE
If the player picked up the rubble from level 3, and kept the screwdriver, 
xe will unscrew the grille OF THE SHALLOW PIPE, and throw a rock at the final switch, 
thus breaking it and opening the door
